# Solutions-Architect
Repository for projects demonstrating cloud knowledge
This repository serves as an example of cloud-based aptitude. It is in the interest of the creator to secure gainful employment as a solutions architect associate. These projects should not only showcase technical aptitude but, more crucially, demonstrate an understanding of architectural principles such as scalability, high availability, cost-optimization, and security.
